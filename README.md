# TikTok Claims Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains my end-of-course portfolio project for the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. The project simulates a real-world workplace scenario at TikTok, where the goal is to classify user-reported content as either a **claim** or an **opinion** to help moderation teams prioritize reviews efficiently.

## Project Scope
- Explore and clean the dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and descriptive statistics  
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate insights  
- Build and evaluate regression and machine learning models  
- Create visualizations and dashboards for technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- Communicate final insights through a project proposal and summary reports  

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics skills learned in the course, including Python programming, statistical analysis, model building, and data visualization, and serves as a portfolio-ready example of my work.

## Current Repo Structure
- `data/` – raw and cleaned datasets (synthetic or anonymized)  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA, hypothesis testing, and modeling  
- `scripts/` – Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling  
- `visualizations/` – plots, charts, and dashboards  
- `docs/` – project proposal, PACE document, and final reports  

## Usage
You can explore the notebooks to see the workflow from data exploration to model evaluation, and review the visualizations and reports for both technical and executive audiences.
